React Assignment on React Context:
Imagine you are building an app that displays the details of a user's profile.
The data about the user includes their name and email. The App
component will pass this user data to a deeply nested child component
called Profile.


‣ In this assignment, you will:
1. Use Prop Drilling to pass the data from App to Profile.
2. Use React Context to pass the data directly to Profile without going
through each component.

VS CODE:
App.js
import React, { createContext, useContext } from "react";
const DataContext = createContext();

function App() {
  const data = { name: "Poojitha", email: "kallurisreepoojitha@gmail.com" };

  return (
    <DataContext.Provider value={data}>
      <Profile />
    </DataContext.Provider>
  );
}
function Profile() {
  const userData = useContext(DataContext);
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>{userData.name}</h1>
      <h2>{userData.email}</h2>
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
